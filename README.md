# Social-Distancing
So for this project, we are making a decision interface to decide whether or not you need to get tested for Covid-19. So all you need to do is answer the questions truthfully, and the program will tell you if it's safe to get tested or not. The way this program works is that we have a text file that is used as input along with your responses. The text file inputted designs a tree that you will be traversing with your answers. You start at the root, and if you answer yes for the root's question, you traverse into the right child, and then go to the left child if you say no. Furthermore, whichever child you go to it treats as the new root. The program keeps on traversing until you reach the end of the tree, and finally get your answer on whether or not you need to go to the hospital. 

An example of using this project would use the line: java Driver data.txt; the text file being the file you build the tree from, and then the command line will prompt you for your required input, and you'll traverse throough out the tree as stated above.
