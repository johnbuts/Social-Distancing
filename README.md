# Social-Distancing
We want to develop a simple COVID-19 social distancing simulation app for the nearby farmers market. The farmers market is divided into blocks by barriers, and the blocks are divided into cells. If a person is assigned a block, and the person in that block is able to navigate through that block to another block trough the cells, the barriers are ineffective.
